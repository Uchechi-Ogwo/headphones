            <h2>Applications of Headphones</h2>
            <p>Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears. They
                are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound. </p>

            <p>Headphones may be used with stationary CD and DVD players, home theater, personal computers, or portable
                devices (e.g., digital audio player/MP3 player, mobile phone), as long as these devices are equipped
                with a headphone jack. Cordless headphones are not connected to their source by a cable. Instead, they
                receive a radio or infrared signal encoded using a radio or infrared transmission link, such as FM,
                Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. These are battery-powered receiver systems, of which the headphone is only a
                component. Cordless headphones are used with events such as a Silent disco or Silent Gig.</p>
